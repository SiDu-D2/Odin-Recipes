    <h1>Cashew Cream</h1>
    <h2>...and its many uses</h2>
    <img src="">
    <p>You might have a problem with creaming cashews. "They don't have nipples, how can they be creamed?" smirks the unassuming victim of a brutal rebuttal who has neglected to consider peanut butter when concocting their latest recyled smirk.</p>
    <p>If this sounds like you, don't worry, there's hope you'll yet know love. Just cream these cashews.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cashews</li>
        <li>Nutritional Yeast</li>
        <li>Juice of lemon</li>
        <li>A blender</li>
        <li>Does water count?</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <ol type="I">
        <li>Soak cashews for a period of time, unspecified here (try asking your cashews when they might be finished soaking)</li>
        <li>Rip cashews away from their precious soaking water (drain them)</li>
        <li>Squeeze a single cashew between your fingers</li>
        <li>Bask in the supple yet callous display of your power. You are the master of your cashews.</li>
        <li>Blend all ingredients together and eat.</li>
        <li>Oh don't forget to season and also add some mustard.</li>

            <h2>...and its many uses</h2>

            <p>You might have a problem with creaming cashews. "They don't have nipples, how can they be creamed?"
                smirks
                the unassuming victim of a brutal rebuttal who has neglected to recall the existence of peanut butter or
                coconut milk.</p>
            <p>If this sounds like you, don't worry, there's hope you'll yet know love. Just cream those cashews (literally just blend them).</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Cashews</li>
                <li>Nutritional Yeast</li>
                <li>Juice of lemon</li>
                <li>A blender</li>
                <li>Does water count?</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <ol type="I">
                <li>Soak cashews for a period of time, unspecified here (try asking your cashews when they might be
                    finished
                    soaking)</li>
                <li>Rip cashews away from their precious soaking water (drain them)</li>
                <li>Squeeze a single cashew between your fingers</li>
                <li>Bask in the supple yet callous display of your power. You are the master of your cashews.</li>
                <li>Blend all ingredients together and eat.</li>
                <li>Oh don't forget to season and also add some mustard.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p id="notes">Slop it in your lasagne as a white sauce, slap it in your pasta to make a creamy bechamel sauce, or slonk it up with slightly less water and baby you got a dip going.</p>

            <p>Buying sushi at the shops is always too expensive for what you get. So you think you'll be a smarty pants
                and make it yourself. Well in just a few short hours, you'll have a newfound appreciation for
                supermarket sushi.</p>
            <p>If this is cultural appropriation I am so sorry.</p>

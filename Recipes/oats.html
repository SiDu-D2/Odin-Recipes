            <h2>It's literally cold porridge</h2>
            <img id="cashew-img" src="https://www.budgetbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Double-Chocolate-Overnight-Oats-toppings.jpg">
            <p>When it's summer but you hate yourself and are trying to eat healthily instead of inhaling mountains of Coco Pops, having oats cold not only mitigates the amount of sweat you'd generate if you were eating hot porridge, it fills you up enough to make you feel full. And isn't tricking your body the whole point of mindfulness or something?</p>
            <p>I don't think you really need a recipe for this but oh well.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Oats, the cheapest you can get</li>
                <li>Things you want to put in your oats such as:</li>
                <li>Peanut butter (correct)</li>
                <li>Sugar (or organic sugar-free maple agave syrup paste)</li>
                <li>Berries</li>
                <li>Seeds</li>
                <li>A glass jar apparently, according to every picture of ovenright oat online</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <ol type="I">
                <li>Put all your ingredients in a container than has the capacity to contain all your ingredients.</li>
                <li>Smother it all with water or milk or both and contemplate what oats even are.</li>
                <li>Stick your container in the fridge and do all this the day before you actually want to eat it.</li>
                <li>Forget to take it to work and eat for dinner when you get home.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p id="notes">Winter Tip! Do all of the above and put it in the microwave anyway to create hot porridge. Like how you forgot about it in the fridge, leave it too long in the microwave and spend the next ten minutes cleaning up molten oats debris. <br>Two recipes on one page, tremendous.</p>

            <h2>Because fish are friends</h2>
            <img id="cashew-img" src="https://cupfulofkale.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Vegan-Chickpea-Tuna-Mayo-720x720.jpg">
            <p>Why even call it tuna when there's no fish involved? Because the language helps ease my wife into a false sense of security which is a great place for her to be as it's actually the only place where she'll actually eat it. </p>
            <p>Be warned, highly technical recipe ahead.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Chickpeas</li>
                <li>Mayonnaise</li>
                <li>Seaweed (wtf?)</li>
                <li>Salt n pepper</li>
                <li>Crunchy veg (optional)</li>
                <li>Bread (optional, but mandatory if making a sandwich)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <ol type="I">
                <li>Drain chickpeas from can or cook them from their dried beginnings.</li>
                <li>Mash 'em. Use a fork, use a masher, use your hands. Just mash 'em.</li>
                <li>Mix with everything else.</li>
                <li>Eat it.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p id="notes">I don't recommend trying to fool anyone into thinking it's real tuna. I also don't recommend having this with pasta and hoping it'll be like tuna pasta, because it won't and you'll regret it.</p>
